# Flight-Delay-ML-Model-Evaluation
Selecting the best classification model for predicting if a flight would be delayed for 15 minutes or not.

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python. It includes example code, datasets, and documentation for the following evaluated models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.

## Getting Started

To get started with the machine learning models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Horlatunjiey1/Flight-Delay-ML-Model-Evaluation
2. Install the required Python packages. Install them using pip install:
3. Navigate to the `Notebook` directory to explore the Jupyter notebook showcasing the implemented models.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to see the model in action with the provided example datasets.

## Included Models

This repository includes the following evaluated machine learning models:

- Decision Tree: A potent model for classification and regression applications that creates a decision tree-like model based on feature values
- Random Forest: A flexible ensemble model that mixes various decision trees to provide predictions and reduce overfitting.
- Logistic Regression: A common model for binary classification that estimates the likelihood that a given occurrence belongs to a particular class.

Each model is implemented in single Jupyter notebook, which contain code, explanations, and visualizations illustrating their usage.

- It include code for forward stepwise subset selection to estimate the contribution of each features to the models
- It also include a python function that evaluate each models with some model parameters to evaluate best parameters 
- Finally, the model with lowest classification error is considered to be the best and it's use to make prediction on the test dataset   

## Datasets

The `Data` directory in this repository includes sample datasets used in the notebook. The dataset is stored in a separate file format (CSV) and comes with a brief description of its features and labels.
